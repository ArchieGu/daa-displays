# DAA-Displays: A Toolkit for Rapid Prototyping Interactive Cockpit Displays
DAA-Displays is a toolkit for model-based design and analysis of cockpit
displays. It includes a library of interactive graphical display elements (widgets)
for cockpit systems, and simulations tools supporting comparative analysis of cockpit displays.

## Latest version
daa-displays-1.0.4

## Functionalities
- Library of interactive graphical display elements (called widgets) for cockpit systems: Compass, Interactive Map, Airspeed Tape, Altitude Tape, Vertical Speed, Virtual Horizon 
- Simulation tools supporting comparative analysis of cockpit displays

## Requirements
The following software is necessary to compile and execute DAA-Displays
- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Java
- C++

## Installation instructions
1. Download the latest release of DAA-Displays from the github repository.
2. Open a terminal window and change directory to the daadisplays folder.
3. Run `make` in the terminal window.
   This command will create a folder dist/ with the JavaScript distribution.
4. Run the bash script `./restart.sh` in the terminal window.
   The script will download the dependencies and launch the daa-server on port 8082.
5. Open Google Chrome at http://localhost:8082 to render an example interactive prototype developed with DAA-Displays.

## Tips for developers
The `./restart.sh` script supports the following options:
- `-pvsio`               (Enables the pvsio process; pvsio must be in the execution path; requires nasalib)
- `-pvsio <path>`        (Enables the pvsio process; the given pvsio path is used for executing the pvsio environment; requires nasalib)
- `-dev`                 (Enables developer mode; in this mode, caching of simulation results is disabled)
- `-port <port number>`  (The server will use the given port)
